We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to a respectful, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project owner. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
